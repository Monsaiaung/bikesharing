# Bike Sharing

## Project Overview
The Purpose of the project is to get investors to fund a bike-share program in Des Monies Iowa by using Citibike's data from New York City as base. Although New York City is quite different from Des Moines, it will be useful to use and analyze Citibike's data to set up a business proposal that will work in Des Moines. 

## Results
