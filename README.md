# Bike Sharing

## Project Overview
The Purpose of the project is to get investors to fund a bike-share program in Des Monies Iowa by using Citibike's data from New York City as base. Although New York City is quite different from Des Moines, it will be useful to use and analyze Citibike's data to set up a business proposal that will work in Des Moines. 

## Results

The data used in this project was Citibike's trip data in August 2019. Tableau Public was used to explore the data and create the following visualizations.

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday
This visualization shows less detailed in terms of hours but compact view of which days are trips mostly taken by Gender and by user types. As one can see Male accounts for most trips and they were taken on Thursdays. One can also see that most rides are by Subscriber of Citibike. As for customers / guest riders it doesn't show much difference in bike usage between Gender. 

## Summary 

The findings of this analysis are:

- A majority of Citibike's users are Male at 65%. 
- Most of the users are subscribers and they are using during rush hours to commute to work and home. 
- For further analysis, knowing the hot spot locations of Users' Startime can provide the stakeholders with the information on locations that need more bikes.
- Knowing the locations and time of Users' Stoptime can also provide stakeholders when and where the maintenance team should be located to optimize and minimize travel time and expanses.

All visualizations above can be looked at in this interactive dashboard for further analysis. [CitiBike Data in a story](https://public.tableau.com/views/CitibikeModuleChallenge/CitibikeDatainaStory?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
